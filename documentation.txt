Frontend
- React

Backend
- Django


How it all works:

Frontend
- components which are reused
- pages are where the components and everything are put together
- app.jsx is what actually renders the app
- perform API calls in the services

Backend
- each app is a different database model and set of API handling
- views is where we handle API calls
